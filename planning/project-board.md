# Project Board

## Columns

1. **TODO**: Claimed and unclaimed issues that no one is actively working on.
2. **IN PROGRESS** Tasks someone is actively working on. Use the `help-wanted`
   label in this column if you are blocked.
3. **WANTED HELP**: Tasks that need contributors to assist with improvements,
   debugging, or additional work. If you're looking for a way to contribute,
   pick a task from this column and start working on it..
4. **READY FOR REVIEW**: Issues with a linked PR to review. If changes are
   requested you can move the issue back to _Todo_ or _In Progress_.
5. **DONE**: Issues that have been closed for any reason including: the linked
   PR was merged, the discussion has finished, or the task is no longer
   necessary.
